## 📈 Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)

The following steps were performed:

1. **Data Cleaning**
   - Checked for null values
   - Converted column types
   - Removed duplicates

2. **Data Visualization**
   - Univariate and bivariate analysis
   - Distribution of churn across various features

3. **Feature Analysis**
   - Correlation matrix
   - Tenure vs. Churn
   - Contract type and Payment method impact

---

## 🔍 Key Insights

- Customers with **month-to-month contracts** are more likely to churn.
- Those using **electronic check** as a payment method show higher churn.
- Customers with **longer tenure** tend to stay longer.
- Features like **Tech Support** and **Online Security** have a strong relationship with churn.

## 📊 Visualization Highlights

Here are some visuals used in the analysis:

- Pie chart of churned vs. non-churned customers
- Histogram of tenure and monthly charges
